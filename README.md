# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
###  Project due in week 3

From the data available at this link (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), this project aims to get better at collating & cleaning data, before it can become useful.

Considering that I (& probably most others in my situation) spend an enormous amount of time on this task, getting a script to 
do most of the heavy lifting makes sense. 

# Files in this repo

The assumption with this code is that all the data has been extracted to the working folder, and no modifications are made to any of the data or its names.

`<Codebook.md>` has all the variables, data, and any transformation or work that was performed to clean up the data. 

`<run_analysis.R>` has the scripts that perform the project's analysis requirements. 

`<averages_data.txt>` is the output of the code to submit for evaluation.
